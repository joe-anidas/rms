# Enhanced Staff Management System Implementation

## Overview
Task 6 - Enhanced Staff Management System has been successfully implemented. The existing `Staff_model` has been extended with comprehensive assignment tracking, performance monitoring, and audit trail functionality.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Assignment Tracking Methods
- **`assign_to_property($staff_id, $property_id, $assignment_type, $assigned_date)`**
  - Assigns staff members to properties with specific roles (sales, maintenance, customer_service)
  - Automatically ends previous assignments of the same type
  - Validates staff and property existence
  - Returns structured response with success/error messages

- **`assign_to_customer($staff_id, $customer_id, $assignment_type, $assigned_date, $notes)`**
  - Assigns staff members to customers with specific roles (primary_contact, sales_support, customer_service)
  - Supports assignment notes for additional context
  - Validates staff and customer existence
  - Maintains assignment history

### 2. Performance Tracking Methods
- **`get_staff_performance($staff_id, $date_from, $date_to)`**
  - Calculates comprehensive performance metrics
  - Tracks active assignments, transaction involvement, completed registrations
  - Supports custom date ranges for analysis
  - Returns detailed performance data

- **`get_workload_distribution()`**
  - Analyzes workload across all staff members
  - Shows property and customer assignment counts
  - Helps identify workload imbalances
  - Supports resource allocation decisions

### 3. Assignment History and Audit Trail
- **`get_assignment_history($staff_id, $limit)`**
  - Retrieves complete assignment history for staff members
  - Combines property and customer assignments
  - Sorted by assignment date (most recent first)
  - Configurable result limit

- **`log_audit($table_name, $record_id, $action, $old_values, $new_values)`**
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all data changes
  - Tracks user information, IP address, and user agent
  - Stores old and new values for change tracking
  - Supports compliance and accountability requirements

### 4. Search and Filtering Capabilities
- **`search_staff($filters)`**
  - Advanced search by name, designation, department, contact information
  - Filter by assignment status (has assignments or not)
  - Configurable sorting and pagination
  - Includes assignment counts in results

### 5. Assignment Management Methods
- **`end_property_assignment($property_id, $assignment_type, $end_date)`**
- **`end_customer_assignment($customer_id, $assignment_type, $end_date)`**
- **`end_staff_assignments($staff_id, $end_date)`**
  - Properly terminate assignments with end dates
  - Maintain assignment history
  - Support staff transitions and role changes

### 6. Enhanced Existing Methods
- **`insert_staff($data)`** - Enhanced with audit logging and better error handling
- **`update_staff($id, $data)`** - Enhanced with audit logging and change tracking
- **`delete_staff($id)`** - Enhanced with assignment checking and audit logging

### 7. Statistics and Analytics
- **`get_staff_statistics()`**
  - Total staff counts by designation and department
  - Active assignment statistics
  - Staff utilization metrics
  - Dashboard-ready data format

## Database Schema Enhancements

### New Table: customer_assignments
```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_assignments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    staff_id INT NOT NULL,
    assignment_type ENUM('primary_contact', 'sales_support', 'customer_service'),
    assigned_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    notes TEXT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Existing Tables Used
- **property_assignments** - For staff-property relationships
- **audit_logs** - For comprehensive audit trail
- **staff** - Enhanced with new methods
- **properties** - Referenced for assignments
- **customers** - Referenced for assignments

## Usage Examples

### Assigning Staff to Property
```php
$result = $this->Staff_model->assign_to_property(1, 5, 'sales', '2025-01-15');
if ($result['success']) {
    echo "Staff assigned successfully: " . $result['message'];
}
```

### Getting Staff Performance
```php
$performance = $this->Staff_model->get_staff_performance(1, '2025-01-01', '2025-01-31');
echo "Active assignments: " . $performance['active_property_assignments'];
echo "Transaction amount: " . $performance['total_transaction_amount'];
```

### Searching Staff
```php
$filters = [
    'name' => 'John',
    'designation' => 'Sales Manager',
    'has_assignments' => 'yes',
    'limit' => 10
];
$staff = $this->Staff_model->search_staff($filters);
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `application/models/Staff_model.php` - Enhanced with all new functionality

### Created Files
- `application/migrations/20250825000002_create_customer_assignments_table.php` - New migration
- `test_enhanced_staff_system.php` - Test script (for database testing)
- `test_staff_model_methods.php` - Method verification script
- `ENHANCED_STAFF_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration**: Execute the customer_assignments table migration
2. **Test Integration**: Test the new methods with actual data
